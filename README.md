SingleMonitor_FPS_Gyroscope_ShootingGame with Unity

Intorduction
This is android moblie FPS game using gyroscope. I convert Unity 3d FPS Tutorial resources from PC platform to Android mobile platform.
Goal of this program is synchronization of monitor & aiming with a cheap setting. There is some benefits with this goal.

First, every FPS games, except VR games, has the same direction of sight and aiming. It causes problems at converting from PC platform to VR platform, because of the cognitive dissonance. So, this program can be smooth connection as platform changer.
Second, VR games which have seperation of sight and aiming demand extra controller expensive. But this can be operating with only a mobile phone.
Features
I use Unity 3d FPS Tutorial resources given as a starterkit by unity. These resources are supposed to use at PC environment, a Mouse and a keyboard(wasd).
I add

softbutton for moving and fire.
use the gyroscope for aiming.
a few changes hierarchy of the models.
I hope aiming with gyroscope, which is very simple system, gives you experience of VR.
